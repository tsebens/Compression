Short script to automate the high level compression of a large number of files over time. The chief intention of this script is to manage the timeing of said compression so that it only occurs during off hours, but during off hours it uses up most of the computer's available resources.

I lay no claim whatsoever on any and all zpaq files. I downloaded those, I didn't write them. I invoke them to handle the actual compression.
